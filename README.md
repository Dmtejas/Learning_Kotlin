# Kotlin Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains my personal notes, code snippets, and practice files as I learn **Kotlin**.  
The goal is to keep track of concepts, hands-on practice, and small experiments while building a strong foundation in the language.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repo will contain multiple Kotlin files, each focusing on specific concepts such as:
- **Basics** – Variables, Data types, Operators
- **Control Flow** – If-else, Loops, When expression
- **Functions** – Default, Named, Vararg, Higher-order functions
- **Classes & Objects** – Constructors, Inheritance, `this`, `super`
- **Properties** – Getters, Setters, Lateinit, `val` vs `var`
- **OOP Concepts** – Abstraction, Interfaces, Enums, Sealed classes
- **Advanced Features** – Collections, Lambdas, Coroutines (later on)

## 🎯 Purpose
- Keep track of what I’ve learned.
- Build a reference for revision.
- Practice writing clean Kotlin code.
- Eventually use the concepts in **Android development** and **backend projects**.
